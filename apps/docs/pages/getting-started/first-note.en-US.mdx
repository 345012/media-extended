# Create Your First Media Note

Welcome to the first part of your journey into efficient video note-taking using the Obsidian Media Extended Plugin. This powerful tool not only enhances your experience with in-vault media but also extends its capabilities to local files outside your vault, remote media from network-attached storage (NAS), or even YouTube videos.

## Opening a player

To kick off, let's try opening a YouTube video directly within Obsidian. You can easily do this by clicking on the link to ["Me at the zoo" video](obsidian://mx-open?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DjNQXAC9IVRw)



Upon opening the video in the enhanced player provided by the plugin, you'll notice two essential buttons at the top of the player: the **Screenshot** and **Timestamp** buttons.

- **Timestamp Button**: Clicking this button will create a new note within Obsidian that includes a timestamp linked directly to the moment in the video you're watching. This feature is invaluable for creating precise, contextual notes on video content.

### Opening Other Media Types

The Media Extended plugin not only simplifies the process of taking notes on YouTube videos but also offers flexibility in accessing various media types:

- **In-Vault Media**: For media stored within your Obsidian vault, you can leverage the built-in quick switcher to open any media file seamlessly. This method utilizes Obsidian's native support for in-vault media, ensuring a smooth playback experience with the enhanced player features.
  
- **Local and Remote Media**: To open media files that are not directly supported by Obsidian, such as those stored outside your vault or on a NAS, use the Media Extended plugin's `open media` command. This command allows you to access a wide range of media sources, ensuring your note-taking capabilities are not limited by file location or type.

The process of integrating media into your notes has never been easier. With the Media Extended plugin, you're equipped to tackle note-taking on video content from various sources, enhancing your learning, research, or entertainment experiences within Obsidian.
