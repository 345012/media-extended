## I want to restore "Link with pane" behavior from earlier versions to take timestamp/screenshot from non-media note [#restore-link-with-pane]

["Link with pane"](https://github.com/PKM-er/media-extended/wiki/Open-Links-in-One-Shared-Player) is a feature that has been refactored in v3. Now you can control the player with commands or your own assigned shortcuts on any active note, without having to associate the player with the note explicitly as before.

You may notice that the player is now marked as "active" with a red icon ðŸŸ¥ in tab header. This indicates that the player is currently being used to take notes. 


For more details about the media commands, please refer to [#Taking Notes](./getting-started/first-note#taking-notes)
